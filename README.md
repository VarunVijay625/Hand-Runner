# Hand Runner Game

This project is a game where you are a child putting your hand out the car window and making believe that you are 
a parkour master! Over the pink skied, urban-mountainous backdrop, your task is to avoid cars below and birds above.
Pressing 'W' will propel you into the air, but being in the air will put you at risk of the birds!
How long will you last in the game of Hand Runner???
Used starter code from Runner project by Prof. Lisa Dion from Advanced Programming with C++ at UVM
